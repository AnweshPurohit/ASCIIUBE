# ASCIUBE (ASCII + CUBE)

This is a Next.js application that showcases an interactive 3D cube rendered using ASCII characters.

The application allows users to manipulate a textual representation of a cube, providing a unique and retro visual experience. It serves as an example of rendering 3D graphics in a non-traditional medium.
