# **App Name**: ASCIIUBE

## Core Features:

- Cube Rendering: Render multiple rotating cubes with different sizes and ASCII characters.
- Z-Buffer Management: Dynamically update the z-buffer to handle overlapping pixels correctly.
- Animated Rotation: Animate the rotation of the cubes along three axes (A, B, C).
- 3D to 2D Projection: Map 3D coordinates to 2D screen coordinates using perspective projection.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark cyan (#008080), reminiscent of early computer displays and the glow of CRT monitors. A saturated and eye-catching color.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#1A1A1A), for a classic dark-themed aesthetic. The almost-black backdrop allows the glowing cyan to stand out.
- Accent color: White (#FFFFFF), inspired by clean and modern interfaces. High brightness and saturation makes it suitable for highlights.
- Font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for a retro computer terminal look. Chosen to convey code snippets, with a computerized look appropriate for the animation's original environment.
- Control the rotation speed and direction of each cube independently.
- Use easing functions for smoother, more natural-looking motion.
